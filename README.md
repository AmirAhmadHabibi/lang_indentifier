#LangId
You can run the langid.py file and give it the parameters, smoothing method and the path to the directory containing the test files.
Without the input values the default method would be "_unsmoothed_" and the default path would be "_./811_a1_test_final/_".

A sample run of the programme would be like this:
```
> python langid.py laplace
```

or
```
> python langid.py interpolation "./test/"
```
